GUESSING A LETTER


"As a user, I want to be able to guess a letter and see appropriate updates on the screen."

When I enter one symbol, one of the following things happens:
- If I enter a symbol that is not a letter (number oder extra symbol), the program tells me that
I should put in a letter.
- If I put in more than one letter, the program tells me to try to type in something with the same
length as the word.
- If I put in a letter that I have already guessed, the program tells me that I have already tried
this letter and that I should try another one without me losing a life.

If my input is only one symbol long and a letter, one of two things happen:
- If the letter is in the word I am trying to guess, the underscores on the screens change into the
letter that I have guessed at the position the letter is in the word. A pop sound appears.
- If the letter is not in the word I am trying to guess, the program makes a disapproving noise and
the letter shows up on the right side of the screen under the label "Guessed letters:".
